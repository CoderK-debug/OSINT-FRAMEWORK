# PRE-RECON
The Pre-Recon Phase is simply added to narrow our objectives (or the Scope of Work - SoW) and to reduce our working time. However, a good investigation needs to be performed with care, patience and a lot of passion.
In this Step (1.1) we will have an overview of the Target(s) and generate a Mindmap according to our findings.

First, we need to set the environment where we will be adding the results and potential intel. For this Step (0.0 - Environment Setup), please follow the instructions on the following [page](#).

Ready?! Let us start Investigation. If you having issues installing tools, setting up your envirnment or difficulties understanding the Reporsitory, please contact me at coderk@protonmail.com.

# A. KNOWING OUR TARGET(S) AND SOURCE(S) OF INFORMATION

Below, is a list of online tools and websites we will be using to identify our Target(s). But we have multiple scenarios.

* Scenario 1: We have a Picture of the Target(s) and Nothing Else;
* Scenario 2: We have just the Name of the Target(s) but an idea of the industry or area he/she/they lives in;
* Scenario 3: We have the Target(s) phone number(s) but nothing else;
* Scenario 4: We have nothing about the Target(s) but files (e.g. PDF, Docx, etc), email(s) address(es), SMS (overwritten) or other types of communication platforms.
* Scenario 5: We found a Virus, Trojan, Malware or pieace of software that is considered malicious and listenning to our devices.

All of the above listed scenarios will need us to focus on what we exactly want to know. 

> This by being realistic! Some Target(s) used advanced methods to perform attacks, some did it by using public devices, and others by simply using their own devices without any kind of security.

Nothing is guaranteed in an Investigation process if advanced interaction with the Target(s) and social engineering is not performed.
