# PRE-RECON
The Pre-Recon Phase is simply added to narrow our objectives (or the Scope of Work - SoW) and to reduce our working time. However, a good investigation needs to be performed with care, patience and a lot of passion.
In this Step (1.1) we will have an overview of the Target(s) and generate a Mindmap according to our findings.

First, we need to set the environment where we will be adding the results and potential intel. For this Step (0.0 - Environment Setup), please follow the instructions on the following [page](#).

Ready?! Let us start Investigation. If you having issues installing tools, setting up your envirnment or difficulties understanding the Reporsitory, please contact me at coderk@protonmail.com.
