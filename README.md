# OSINT FRAMEWORK
An OSINT Framewrok made for fast and effective results.


## INTRODUCTION
For an accurate investigation, you need a set of advanced search engines and tools. These assets are deployed in different ways and will require certain Linux Operating Systems, Dependencies and Devices.

### - Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### - Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## HOW IT WORKS
In this Framework, I focused on 2 types of Investigations. a. Person and b. Company/Entity.
You will find 2 lists with different tools or sometimes, you might use the same tool for multiple types of researches.


## MAIN NOTES
I have listed Free, Freemium and Premium tools. This means certain tools will need to be unlocked with a subscription or a once-off payement.


## DISCLAIMER
This Framework is published for ethical and educational purposes. I am not responsible of any misuse of the Framework. Also, tools and technics are beyond my control.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at coderk@protonmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
