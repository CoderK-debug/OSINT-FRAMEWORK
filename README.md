# OSINT FRAMEWORK
An OSINT Framewrok made for fast and effective results.

# INTRODUCTION
For an accurate investigation, you need a set of advanced search engines and tools. These assets are deployed in different ways and will require certain Linux Operating Systems, Dependencies and Devices.

# HOW IT WORKS
In this Framework, I focused on 2 types of Investigations. a. Person and b. Company/Entity.
You will find 2 lists with different tools or sometimes, you might use the same tool for multiple types of researches.

# MAIN NOTES
I have listed free, Freemium and Premium tools. This means certain tools will need to be unlocked with a subscription or a once-off payement.

# DISCLAIMER
This Framework is published for ethical and educational purposes. I am not responsible of any misuse of the Framework. Also, tools and technics are beyond my control.
