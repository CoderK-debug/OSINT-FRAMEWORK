## INTRODUCTION
For an accurate investigation, you need a set of advanced search engines and tools. These assets are deployed in different ways and will require certain Linux Operating Systems, Dependencies and Devices.

### - Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

### - Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## HOW IT WORKS
In this Framework, I focused on 2 types of Investigations. 

* Person 
* Company/Entity

You will find 2 lists with different tools or sometimes, you might use the same tool for multiple types of researches.

## MAIN NOTES
I have listed Free, Freemium and Premium tools. This means certain tools will need to be unlocked with a subscription or a once-off payement.

## DISCLAIMER
This Framework is published and updated for ethical or educational purposes only. I am not responsible of any misuse of the Framework. Tools, payloads and ceratin technics/methods are beyond my control.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at coderk@protonmail.com. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
