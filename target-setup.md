# TARGET SETUP
For an accurate investigation, you need to start by setting up the target logic.
This by making a list of keywords, usernames, communication channels and contacts in a friendly way.

# SHORT SMART STEPS BEFORE STARTING

1. Pre-Recon the target;
2. Interaction with the Target; and,
3. Target setup finalization.

# KEYWORDS LIST LOGIC EXAMPLE

Our target full name is: [John Doe]

Logic Example: 

* john doe
* doe john
* d john
* john d
* john.doe 
* doe.john 
* john-doe 
* doe-john 
* johndoe 
* doejohn
* d.john
* j.doe
* d-john
* j-doe
* jdoe
* johnd
* djohn
* doej

The reason why we need to invert the keywrods is mainly because a user can subscribe on different platforms by using his/her name in different logics. Sometime you will find an extra piece of code after the username (e.g. username1222871762 or username?id=xyz) that needs to be considered and added to the list.

Please keep in mind that every result needs to be verified as related to the target before being considered as Positive Records. This to avoid having false Intel and Records about the target.
