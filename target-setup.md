# TARGET SETUP
For an accurate investigation, you need to start by setting up the target logic.
This by making a list of keywords, usernames, communication channels and contacts in a friendly way.

# SHORT SMART STEP BY STEP

1. Pre-Recon the target;
2. Interaction with the Target; and,
3. Target setup finalization.

# TOOLS FOR THIS EXERCISE
We all know that having unorganized files and records makes the task more difficult and increases delivery timefreame. This is why, I want to make sure my records are perfectly organized for an efficient operation.

* Tool 1: Graphical UI
* Tool 2: CLI
* Tool 3: Advanced

# KEYWORDS LIST LOGIC EXAMPLE

Our target name is: [John Doe]

Logic Example: 

* john doe
* doe john
* d john
* john d
* john.doe 
* doe.john 
* john-doe 
* doe-john 
* johndoe 
* doejohn
* d.john
* j.doe
* d-john
* j-doe
* jdoe
* johnd
* djohn
* doej

The reason why we invert the keywrods is mainly because a user can subscribe on different platforms by using his/her name in different logics. Sometime you will find an extra piece of code after the username (e.g. username1222871762 or username?id=xyz) that needs to be considered and added to the list.

Please keep in mind that every result needs to be verified as related to the target before being considered as part of the list. This to avoid havinf records not related to the target.
